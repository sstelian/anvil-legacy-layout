This repository includes the 3 boards designed for the Anvil sumo robot by Stelian Saracut and Virgil Litan in 2016.

The motor driver board is not functional. The other 2 boards are tested and were previously used on our robot.

Build these boards on your own risk. We do not take responsibility for any damage related to building or using these designs.
